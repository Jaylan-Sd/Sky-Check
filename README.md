**Author:** Jaylan Saad

## 📋 Description

**Sky Check** is a simple one‑page weather web app that lets users check the current weather for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.  
It displays the city name, temperature, weather description, and a dynamic weather icon – all in a clean, modern card design.

This project was built as an introductory JavaScript, HTML, and CSS exercise, and designed in Figma.
